# Extras üß©

Alongside Libre19 parts and components, this repository also contains hardware components that I use to deploy my homelab. The mechanical target platform is either a 10-inch half-rack or a full-width 19-inch rack depending on the size of the site.

## Components üì¶

- [2.5-inch drive tray for HP Proliant DL180 G6][file-drive-tray-2in]
- [Network stack][docs-network-stack] most likely to be deprecated in favor of [Libre19][repo-libre19]
