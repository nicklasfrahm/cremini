# Hardware üî©

This repository contains a variety of hardware components that I use to deploy my homelab.

The mechanical target platform is either a 10-inch half-rack or a full-width 19-inch rack depending on the size of the site. You may find a comparison of a 10-inch and a 19-inch rack in [this graphic][img-10-vs-19-inch].

## Components üì¶

- [2.5-inch drive tray for HP Proliant DL180 G6][file-drive-tray-2in]
- [Network stack][docs-network-stack]

## Development üöß

This section describes how the different components are developed.

### Mechanical design üìê

This project uses [SolidPython][github-solidpython] and [OpenSCAD][website-openscad] for its mechanical design, because it makes it possible to easily create scripts that can be tracked in Git. Additionally, the entire CAD workflow can be automated.

- [x] SCAD code generation via `make netstack_v0_assembly.scad`
- [x] STL file generation via `make netstack_v0_assembly.stl`
- [ ] Automatic deployment of STL files to [Thingiverse][website-thingiverse]
- [ ] GCODE generation, possibly via [CURA engine][reddit-cura-cli]
