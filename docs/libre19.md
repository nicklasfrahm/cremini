# Libre19 ðŸ”©

Libre19 is an open hardware form factor for 10-inch network shelves and 19-inch server racks. It is inspired by the [Open19][website-open19] project, but not affiliated with or officially endorsed by Open19 in any way.

## Features âœ¨

- **Simple adoption**  
  Libre19 is designed to be easily adopted. Hence it only strictly defines mechanical target dimensions.

- **Flexible connectors**  
  Open19 introduces specialized connectors for networking and power distribution. Although this is great for new deployments, it's not very useful for custom-built, highly-specialized or prototype hardware platforms.

- **Small form factor**  
  Libre19 is designed to be small. It therefore deliberately discourages the use of very deep equipment.

- **10-inch network chassis support**  
  Because of its small form factor, Libre19 also supports 10-inch network shelves.

## Use cases ðŸ’¡

- **Usage of refurbished or legacy hardware**  
  Most old hardware does not support Open19's form factor, because it tighly in Libre 19 is designed to be compatible with most old hardware.

- **Homelabs and small to medium enterprises**  
  Libre19 aims to provide a platform that bridges the gap between public-cloud-scale data centers and DIY hardware assemblies in homelabs.

## Terminology ðŸ“š

_To be defined; brick, chassis._
